# Ingot
Since the original exploit with the bookmarklet was patched, I decided to improve it to see if i could get it working without bookmarklets.

1. Show your bookmarks bar with `ctrl + shift + b`

2. Right click on the bar and choose `Add Page`

3. Set the name to `Ingot` and the URL to the code below or [here](https://github.com/FogNetwork/Ingot/blob/main/bookmarklet.js)
